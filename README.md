EEG signals are collected using OpenBCI, during the execution of motor activities, motor imaging and motion observation!

New version of data acquisition in folder **"AcquisitionProgram_V2.0"** , with two methods.
- Link: https://github.com/vasanza/OpenBCI/tree/main/AcquisitionProgram_V2.0
- Method 1 : Using pyLSL (Library) and OpenBCI_GUI
- Method 2 : Using Brainflow (Library)

Note: Check the path of the images and the folder to save the files
